# Get Bicep Deployments

This action assists in determining which Bicep deployments should be deployed based on conditions like the Github event, modified files, regex and environment filters and the `deploymentconfig.json` or `deploymentconfig.jsonc` configuration file.

## How to use this action

This action can be used multiple ways.

- Single deployments
- Part of a dynamic, multi-deployment strategy using the `matrix` capabilities in Github.

Both these approaches can be adjusted using the filter capabilities of the action.

It requires the repository to be checked out before use.

It is called as a step like this:

```yaml
# ...
steps:
  - name: Checkout repository
    uses: actions/checkout@v6

  - name: Get Bicep Deployments
    id: get-bicep-deployments
    uses: open-climpr/get-bicep-deployments@v1
    with:
      deployments-root-directory: deployments
# ...
```

## Parameters

### `deployments-root-directory`

The root directory in which deployments are located.

> NOTE: It needs to be a directory at least one level above the deployment directory. I.e. `deployments` if the desired deployment is the following: `deployments/sample-deployment/prod.bicepparam`.

### `event-name`

The Github event name that triggers the workflow. This decides the primary logic for which deployments to include.
Supported events are: `push`, `schedule`, `pull_request_target` and `workflow_dispatch`.

- `push`: Only includes deployments if any related files are modified in the commit.
- `schedule`: Includes all deployments.
- `pull_request_target`: Only includes deployments if any related files are modified in the pull request.
- `workflow_dispatch`: Manual trigger. Includes all deployments by default, but requires filters.

### `environment`

If this parameter is specified, only deployments matching the specified environment is included.

> NOTE: The environment is calculated from the first dot delimited element in the `.bicepparam` file name. I.e. `prod` in `prod.bicepparam` or `prod.main.bicepparam`.

### `environment-pattern`

If this parameter is specified, only deployments matching the specified environment regex pattern is included.

> NOTE: The environment is calculated from the first dot delimited element in the `.bicepparam` file name. I.e. `prod` in `prod.bicepparam` or `prod.main.bicepparam`.

### `pattern`

If this parameter is specified, only the deployments matching the specified regex pattern is included.

> NOTE: This pattern is matched against the deployment **directory**. I.e. `sample-deployment` in the following directory structure: `deployments/sample-deployment/prod.bicepparam`.

## Outputs

```json
{
  "deployments": [<deployments>] // JSON array of deployments (see schema below)
}
```

### `deployments`

**Schema**

```jsonc
[
  {
    "Name": string, // Name of the deployment (Directory name)
    "Environment": string, // Name of the environment (from the .bicepparam or .bicep file name)
    "DeploymentFile": string, // Full path to the .bicepparam or .bicep file used for deployment
    "ParameterFile": string?, // Full path to the .bicepparam file used for deployment (if any)
    "References": string[], // List of all files referenced by the deployment (including the deployment file itself)
    "Deploy": boolean, // Whether this deployment should be deployed or not
    "Modified": boolean // Whether any of the referenced files are modified in the triggering commit/pull request
  }
]
```

**Example**

```jsonc
[
  {
    "Name": "sample-deployment",
    "Environment": "prod",
    "DeploymentFile": "/home/runner/work/bi-az-banner-online/bi-az-banner-online/bicep-deployments/sample-deployment/prod.bicepparam",
    "ParameterFile": "/home/runner/work/bi-az-banner-online/bi-az-banner-online/bicep-deployments/sample-deployment/prod.bicepparam",
    "References": [
      "./bicep-deployments/sample-deployment/modules/sample-submodule/main.bicep",
      "./bicep-deployments/sample-deployment/main.bicep",
      "./bicep-deployments/sample-deployment/prod.bicepparam"
    ],
    "Deploy": true,
    "Modified": false
  }
